Network.NetClient
	-ctor(string hostname, uint16_t port, <callable> callback, bool continueOnError, bool suppressOutput)
	-- string hostname: hostname of connection
	-- uint16_t port: port to connect to
	-- <callable> callback: to be called upon recieving message through connection
	-- -- takes 1 argument of _ty type (no type/ null guarantees)
	-- bool continueOnError: whether or not connection will exit upon error thrown from callback or when parsing recieved message
	-- bool suppressOutput: whether or not to print debug messages

	- Start()
	-- starts listening for messages
	-- when a message is available, calls the callback function and passes in the message object
	!= Blocking: main thread execution will wait on messages until Stop is called
	!= Does NOT connect to remote host, simply waits for messages in queue. To connect to remote host, Connect should be called prior to Start or StartAsync call

	- StartAsync()
	-- starts listening for messages in a new thread
	-- when a message is available, calls the callback function and passes in the message object
	!= NonBlocking: main thread execution will continue and messages will be processed asynchronously
	!= Does NOT connect to remote host, simply waits for messages in queue. To connect to remote host, Connect should be called prior to Start or StartAsync call

	- Stop()
	-- Stops message thread execution

	- Connect()
	-- attempts to connect to remote host
	-- if successful, returns true; otherwise false
	!= does not start message callback thread (but is necessary to recieve messages), for that, Start or StartAsync should be called

	- IsConnected()
	-- returns true if client is connected to server, false otherwise
	
	- Disconnect()
	-- disconnect from server

Network.NetServer
	- ctor(uint16_t port, <callable> onClientConnect, <callable> onClientValidated,<callable> onClientDisconnect, bool continueOnError, bool suppressOutput)
	-- uint16_t port: port to host on
	-- <callable> onClientConnect: to be called upon recieving connection attempt
	-- -- takes 2 arguments of string and uint16_t type
	-- -- arg 1 is hostname arg 2 is port 
	-- -- RETURNS true to approve connection or false to deny connection
	-- <callable> onClientValidated to be called upon connection validation
	-- -- takes 1 argument of uint32_t type
	-- -- arg is equal to id of client connection 
	-- -- actual client object can be retrieved through method GetClientById(uint32_t id)
	-- <callable> onClientDisconnect to be called upon client disconnect
	-- -- takes 1 argument of uint32_t type
	-- -- arg is equal to id of client connection 
	-- -- actual client object can be retrieved through method GetClientById(uint32_t id)
	-- bool continueOnError: whether or not connection will exit upon error thrown from callback or when parsing recieved message
	-- bool suppressOutput: whether or not to print debug messages

	- GetClientById(uint16_t id)
	-- uint16_t id: id of client to retrieve
	-- returns native net::connection<MsgType> pointing to client or nullptr

	- Start()
	-- starts listening for connections

	- Update(uint32_t maxMessages, bool wait)
	-- uint32_t maxMessages: maximum number of messages for this call of Update
	-- bool wait: whether or not to wait for at least one message to be pushed to queue
	!= Do NOT call Update inside of handler callback function, this will result in server stop

	- Stop()
	-- Stops the server
	!= Do NOT call Stop inside of handler callback function, will result in server stop or crash


	- MessageClient(uint32_t clientId, _ty msg)
	-- serializes msg object and sends to client
	-- attempts to resolve client id to connection object
	-- if the connection object is null, does not attempt to send
	-- uint32_t clientId: id of client 
	-- _ty msg: any object to send

	-MessageAll(_ty msg, uint32_t except)
	-- serializes msg object and sends to all currently connected clients, except client with id that was passed in arg 2
	-- _ty msg: any object to send
	-- uint32_t except: client to be ignored when sending the message
